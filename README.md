SQLAlchemy Homework - Surfs Up!

Before taking a trip to Honolulu, Hawaii I completed a climate analysis using 7 years of temperature and precipitation data recorded from 9 different weather stations in Hawaii. 

To complete my analysis and exploration of the data, I used Python and SQLAlchemy. I used Pandas to make dataframes, and Matplotlib to create a line plot and histogram.

I then designed a Flask API based on the queries that I developed in my temperature and precipitation analysis.
